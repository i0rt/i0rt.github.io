# Pie Crust

* 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
* 1 tbsp granulated sugar
* 1 tsp baking powder
* 1 tsp fine sea salt
* 1 cup cold unsalted butter, cut into 1⁄2-inch cubes
* 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
* 1 cup ice water
* 1 large egg, lightly beaten
* 2 tbsp demerara sugar

1. Whisk together flour, granulated sugar, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl. Cut in butter using a pastry blender. Stir together vinegar and 1⁄2 cup ice water, drizzle over flour mixture, and stir lightly with a fork until flour is moistened. (If dough seems dry, add ice water, 1 to 2 tablespoons at a time, until a small piece of dough mostly holds together when slightly pressed.)
1. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured work surface, and gather into a tight mound. Using the heel of your hand and working from side to side, smear dough by pushing away from you a little at a time and working your way down the mass of dough, creating flat layers. Once complete, use a dough scraper to bring both short ends of dough up and over, folding so ends meet in the middle and creating 2 layers. Repeat smearing-and-folding process once.
1. Divide dough in half; shape each half into a flat disk. Wrap disks in plastic wrap, and chill at least 1 hour or up to overnight.
1. Remove chilled dough disks from refrigerator; let stand at room temperature 10 to 15 minutes. Place 1 dough disk on a lightly floured surface; dust top of dough with flour. Using a lightly floured rolling pin, roll disk into a 12-inch circle (2 to 3 inches larger than pie plate and about 1⁄8 inch thick). Repeat process with second disk.
1. Fit 1 piecrust into a 9-inch pie plate. Trim dough to allow about 1 1⁄2 inches of excess to extend over sides. Reserve scraps. Fold dough edges under and crimp. Cover with plastic wrap, and chill at least 30 minutes or up to 3 days, or freeze for up to 1 month.
1. Cut designs, using small leaf-shaped cookie cutters, from reserved scraps of dough and remaining dough round. Place leaf cutouts on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet, and chill 30 minutes.
1. Preheat oven to 400°F. Line chilled pie shell with aluminum foil or parchment paper; fill with dried beans or pie weights. Bake in preheated oven until edges are very lightly browned, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove foil and beans; return to oven. Continue baking until lightly golden, about 10 more minutes. Cool completely on a wire rack, about 30 minutes.
1. Brush leaf cutouts with egg; sprinkle with demerara sugar. Bake at 400°F until golden, 8 to 10 minutes. Set aside. Reduce oven temperature to 350°F.

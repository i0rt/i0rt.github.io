# Pumpkin Pie

* 2 cups canned pumpkin
* 1 cup heavy cream
* 3 large eggs, lightly beaten
* 2 tbsp pure cane syrup
* 1/2 cup granulated sugar
* 1/2 cup light brown sugar
* 1 tsp ground cinnamon
* 1 tsp vanilla extract
* 1/2 tsp fine sea salt
* 1/4 tsp ground cardamom
* 1/4 tsp ground cloves
* 1/4 tsp ground ginger
* 1 [pie crust](./pie-crust)

1. Preheat oven to 350Â°F
1. Whisk together all ingredients in a large bowl. Pour into cooled crust, cover crust with foil to prevent over browning
1. Bake, remove foil after 20 minutes. Continue baking until filling is firm around edges but still jiggles slightly in center, 45-50 minutes total
1. Cool completely, about 3 hours. Filling will continue to firm up as it cools
1. Decorate with cutouts
